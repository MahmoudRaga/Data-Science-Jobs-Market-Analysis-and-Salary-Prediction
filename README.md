# 💼 Data Jobs Market Analysis & Salary Prediction

This project analyzes the data jobs market using **Power BI dashboards** and predicts **data scientist salaries** using a Machine Learning model in **Python**.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

We built a comprehensive 3-page dashboard from a dataset containing thousands of data job postings. Each page explores a different business perspective:

### 🔹 Page 1: General Overview
- Total number of job listings
- Number of unique job titles and companies
- Top 10 countries hiring the most
- Most demanded work settings and employment types

### 🔹 Page 2: Salary & Role Insights
- Average salary by:
  - Work setting (remote/in-office/hybrid)
  - Experience level
  - Employment type
- Comparison of average salary across top job titles

### 🔹 Page 3: Job Market Exploration
- Top 10 job titles
- Distribution by employment type, experience, and location
- Dynamic filters:
  - Experience Level
  - Employment Type
  - Work Setting
  - Company Location
  - Job Title (searchable)

Tooltips and filters were added to enhance interactivity.

## 📈 Salary Prediction – Jupyter Notebook

The notebook (`Data science jobs Salary Prediction.ipynb`) contains a machine learning pipeline to predict **data scientist salaries** based on job features.

### 🔍 Features used:
- Job Title
- Experience Level
- Employment Type
- Work Setting
- Company Location
- Employee Residence

### 🔧 Model:
- Preprocessing: Label Encoding, Data Standarization , 
- Model: CatBoostRegressor (can be changed to XGBoost or other models)
- Evaluation: MAE, R² Score

### 📁 Files:
- `jobs_in_data.csv`: The original dataset used for both dashboard and modeling.
- `Data-science-jobs-Salary-Prediction.ipynb`: The notebook containing preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix`: The dashboard file (optional if shared).
- `README.md`: You are here.
